# Parentheses-Snake game!

A Clojure snake game!
This is based on a general snake game, though inspired by the 4Clojure questions,
in order to keep playing without failing you have to collect BALANCED PARENTHESES!!!



## Usage
- Download/clone the repo 
- cd to the game folder 
- Start the Clojure REPL (using Leiningen as the build and project management tool ) : 
```user$: lein repl ```
